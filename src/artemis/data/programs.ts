    faqs: [
      { q: "What is an Xcitizen?", a: "Xcitizens are neither employees nor students; they are deployed operators who receive a flat, needs-based stipend ($500-$1,200/mo). They do not clock in, they do not receive benefits, and they are not guaranteed employment after 24 months. They are mission-deployed personnel whose compensation is tied to operational outcomes, not time served." },
      { q: "What happens after 24 months?", a: "Month 24 is a hard cliff. The top 3% of Xcitizens: the 'Keepers', transition to permanent payrolls within the spun-out entity. The remaining 97%, 'The Cycled', are severed with performance equity grants carrying 36-month vesting schedules. This is not a failure; it is the design. The League builds ventures, not careers." },
      { q: "How are pods formed?", a: "Pods are formed via a deterministic algorithm that weighs Deployment Classification and Archetype compatibility. The Civilizational Field Typing Assessment observes behavior under stress, not stated preference, to assign one of six Archetypes: Pilot, Builder, Hustler, Operator, Tracker, or Comms. The algorithm then composes Pods to maximize complementary strengths within the assigned field." },
      { q: "What is the Crucible?", a: "The Crucible is an 8-week psychological demolition and reconstruction process that overwrites compliance conditioning with execution capability. It consists of 'The Shock' (systematic destabilization of habitual thought patterns) and 'The Wall' (sustained cognitive exhaustion that strips away social performance). Those who survive emerge with an operational architecture, a new cognitive OS, optimized for high-stakes deployment under uncertainty." },
      { q: "What are the Nine Civilizational Fields?", a: "The Nine Civilizational Fields are the operational domains the League has identified as essential infrastructure for the Global South: Water Systems, Energy Systems, Food & Agriculture, Health & Mobility, Built Environment, Data & Intelligence, Logistics & Trade, Governance & Identity, and Education & Human Capital. Every ProtoCo is commissioned against one of these fields." },
      { q: "Can I leave the program early?", a: "Technically yes, but the cost is total forfeiture of all equity and performance grants. The program is designed as a commitment device: the 24-month cliff exists precisely because infrastructure cannot be built by people who have an easy exit. Early departures are rare and economically punitive." }

The end goal is a spun-out, independent NewCo with its own governance, external investment, and strategic partnerships, a market-defining company that originated from the Studio but no longer depends on it." },

Surviving ProtoCos become NewCos with capital and teams. Finally, successful NewCos spin out as independent entities. The entire cycle is designed to compress years of validation into months." },
      { q: "Who owns the IP?", a: "Under the Studio model, IP is initially held by the Studio and shared across ProtoCos and NewCos. Upon spinout, the NewCo receives a perpetual license to relevant IP and ownership of IP generated during the NewCo stage. This shared IP infrastructure gives Studio ventures an unfair advantage over independent startups." }
