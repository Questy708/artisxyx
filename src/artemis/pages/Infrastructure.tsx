              54gene couldn&apos;t find a working cold chain. Sendy couldn&apos;t find
              a paved road. Dash couldn&apos;t find an inter operable banking rail. Each

              xCelero solves this by building shared production infrastructure —
              foundries with CNC machines and 5-axis mills running across 30 ventures&apos;
              schedules, labs with bioreactors that never sit idle, GPU clusters
              processing 40 ventures&apos; training jobs, component libraries where
              one venture&apos;s tested part becomes every other venture&apos;s
              starting point. The method compounds: when Venture A solves cold-chain
              logistics in Nairobi, Venture B in Accra inherits the playbook — not
              the problem.
